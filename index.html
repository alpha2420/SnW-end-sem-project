            <div class="keypoints">
                <li>Set a Budget
                Determine your total trip budget: Decide how much you’re willing to spend on flights, accommodation, food, and activities. This will help guide all your decisions.
                Allocate funds to each category: Assign specific amounts to transportation, lodging, food, and activities to ensure you don’t overspend on one area.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="keypoints">
                <li>Choose Affordable Destinations
                    Travel to budget-friendly countries: Some countries are naturally cheaper than others, depending on the exchange rate, cost of living, and tourism prices. Countries in Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and Central America often offer great value.
                    Avoid high-demand tourist destinations: Popular cities or resorts tend to be expensive. Instead, consider lesser-known gems that offer similar experiences at a fraction of the cost.

            </div>
            <div class="keypoints">
                <li>
                    Be Flexible with Travel Dates
                    Travel during off-peak seasons: Flights, accommodation, and attractions tend to be cheaper when you avoid peak travel periods (holidays, summer, etc.). Try to travel during shoulder seasons when prices are lower, but weather is still good.
                    Be flexible with flight dates: Airfares can vary greatly depending on the day of the week, time of day, and season. Use flexible date search tools on flight comparison websites like Skyscanner or Google Flights to find the cheapest options.

            </div>
            <div class="keypoints">
                <li> Use Budget Airlines
                    Book low-cost carriers: Budget airlines like Ryanair, EasyJet, Spirit, or Southwest can offer much cheaper flights. Just be mindful of additional fees for checked luggage, seat selection, and food.
                    Fly to alternative airports: Sometimes flying into a secondary airport (a smaller airport near a major city) can save you money.

            <div class="keypoints">
                <li>
                    Book Flights in Advance
                    Book early: Booking flights well in advance (ideally 3-6 weeks for domestic and 2-3 months for international travel) can help you secure the best rates.
                    Use fare comparison websites: Websites like Kayak, Google Flights, Skyscanner, and Momondo allow you to compare prices across multiple airlines and booking sites.

                    Plan Your Activities & Attractions in Advance
                    Book tickets online: Many attractions offer discounts for booking tickets in advance or online.
                    Research free events: Look for free events or festivals happening at your destination during your travel dates.
                    Look for group discounts: Some attractions offer discounts if you're traveling with a group, so check for any special deals.
